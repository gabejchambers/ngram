This invitation was extended with that delightful affectation of
heartiness that a man can assume when he believes that the person
invited will never avail himself of the courtesy. Fortunately for the
purpose of this story, Master Philip Hayn, whom Mr. Tramlay had asked to
call, was too young and too unaccustomed to the usages of polite society
to regard the remark in any but its actual sense.

It would have seemed odd to any one knowing the two men and their
respective stations in life. Tramlay was a New York merchant, well known
and of fair standing in the iron trade; Hayn was son of the farmer at
whose house the Tramlay family had passed the summer. When the Tramlays
determined to exchange the late summer dust of the country for the early
autumn dust of the city, it was Philip who drove the old-fashioned
carryall that transported them from the farm to the railway-station. The
head of the merchant's family was attired like a well-to-do
business-man; Philip's coat, vest, and trousers were remnants of three different suits, none of recent cut.
